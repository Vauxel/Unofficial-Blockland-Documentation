# Welcome

Unnofficial Blockland Documentation is a community-driven documentation of the [TGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_(game_engine)) scripting language, TorqueScript, as it is implemented in the lego-like sandbox game, [Blockland](http://blockland.us/).

However, this documentation does not encompass every function in Blockland's API; It only strives to document and provide information on the more fundamental functions and methods provided.  For a complete, but less detailed, hierarchy and documentation of the functions, classes, and datablocks (etc) in Blockland's API, please visit the [Blockland API Website](http://bldocs.nullable.se/html/) provided by [DontCare4Free](http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?action=profile;u=33503).
